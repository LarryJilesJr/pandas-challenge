The script calculates key financial and scolastic achievment data to provide insights into the overall student performance over within different cschool types. There is also a Word document of my findings included, which can be easily read and shared with other interested parties.

The script uses Python's basic csv module and also utilizes pandas along with JupyterNotebook in order to create DataFrames. The DataFrames enhaned my analysis and gave a clearer picture of the underlining data.
